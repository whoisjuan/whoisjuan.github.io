        <br><br>
        <p class="work-p"> The Procore Mobile App is used by thousands of Construction Field Workers to capture issues, track progress and measure quality/safety. Procore Mobile is widely used by superindentendents, project managers, foremen and other on-field workers.</p>

        <p class="work-p">One challenge that arised with the growth of the product and the addition of more comprehensive issue capturing tools, was the cumbersomeness around finding specifc groups of issues or items. As a construction project move forward thousands of items are collectively recorded by different stakholders. Those items need to be referenced in later stages. <mark>Procore users were having an unoptimal experience when it came to find and reference previously create items</mark>.</p>

        <p class="work-p">I was tasked with creating an scalable and resuable UX pattern to solve this problem.</p>

        <p class="work-p bold centered-text">What kind of solution can provide an agnostic filtering pattern and an fast way to find specific groups of items with easiness?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row process">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h2 class="centered sechead firstsec"><span class="brackets">[</span>PROCESS<span class="brackets">]</span></h2>
        <br><br>
        <p class="work-p">
        The first step I took to solve this problem, was to <mark>analyze anecdotical and quantitave data</mark>, in order to build an insight around the problem. Anecdotical data was gathered from 3 main sources: User Feedback Tickets, Customer Support Tickets and User Sessions Recordings.<p>
        <p class="work-p">
        Quantitave data was gathered from our analytics software (Google Analytics and Appsee). I extracted pertinent information from the main events dataset and analyzed sessions that mainly ocurred in our specific tools lists views. I <mark>analyzed funnels and focused in understanding the behavior behind the available filtering</mark> methods (Segmented Controls and String Search).</p>
        <p class="work-p">
        After gathering all the data and analyzing the general user requests, the problem became evident: Users wanted more granular control to filter down the items lists, but they had anspecial interest in filtering items by two specific properties (Assignees and Locations)</.
        </p>
        <p class="work-p">
        Before I could create new UI controls for the requested filters, I had to overcome the <mark>challenge of working with limited real estate</mark>. To solve this, I explored several solutions and finally created a prototype of a tool that had a new view for filters.
        <br>
        I then went through a <mark>formal design critique process</mark> in which I got feedback from other Product Designers and stakeholders. Finally, I performed a series of usability calls to validate the new real estate paradigms. The calls proved that the paradigm was usable and easy to learn.</p>
        <p class="work-p">The new filtering paradigm improved the screen real estate usage by doing two optimizations:</p>
        <p class="work-p">1) Segmented Controllers were deprecated giving extra room for the list elements and other potential UI elements.</p>
        <p class="work-p">2) A complete new view for filters was adopted, <mark>taking advantage of the virtual real estate</mark> that until now was rarely used in Procore.
        Here is a view of first the prototype against a view without the new filter paradigm:</p>
        <div class="row special-margin">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2 borderImage" src="assets/img/work/procore/filterpunch.jpeg" alt=""><p>Old List View with Segmented Controls</p></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2 borderImage" src="assets/img/work/procore/opening.gif" alt=""><p>1st Prototype with New Filters View</p></div>
        </div>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> It was pretty clear that the main problem was the lack of empathy with the patients context reflected on a cold and disconnected experience. Based on these findings we decided to create an educational app to replace the old and dry booklets. We also decided that we wanted an app with a very richful experience that would include engaging mini-games and a healthcare provider mode to allow the healthcare providers to use it as a resource to explain their health recommendations and treatments.</p>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> A a Product Designer I was in charge of creating the interaction flows, the content experience and the general graphical interface composition. Part of my work was also to create a seamless transition to the games that were being concetualized by another team member (game designer).</p>
        <p class="work-p"> By testing with early iterations of a user flow and performing discovery interviews with the stakeholders and certain patients, I was able to defione the required experience and its components.</p>
				<p class="work-p"> Here is a photo of one of the user interviews that we performed to learn about out target demographic.</p>
				<img class="max-image" src="assets/img/work/patient.png" alt="">
				<p class="work-p special-margin"> In these interviews we used different design research techniques like AEOUT Observations combined with Particpatory Activities to encourage users to share more insights. After fianlizing the first set of interviews and analyzing the available data I came up with some conclusions and I suggested the team to rule our experience by four main design heuristics:</p>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"></p>
        <ul class="work-p">
        <li class="bold"> Visibility:</li><p class="work-p">Eveything in the app should be visually relevant, high contrast and readable.</p>
        <li class="bold"> Redundancy:</li><p class="work-p"> In order to tackle any issue with the experience progress I suggested the team to create different interactions and mechanics to move through the app.</p>
        <li class="bold"> Feedback Loop:</li><p class="work-p">The app should provide constant feedback of its current state and upcoming states as well as giving a clear indication of progress.</p>
        <li class="bold"> Simmetry:</li><p class="work-p">The flow of the app should be symmetrical. This means that the app navigation should hold a pattern and build familar routes to progress and review the available content.</p></ul>

        <p class="work-p"> Now that we had some facts and a clear roadmap I started designing a flow for the app. </p>
        <p class="work-p"> Here is an example of an early user flow that was used to determine the main heuristics: </p>
        <img src="assets/img/work/firstFlow.png" alt="">
        <p class="work-p"> I also started working on the concept and the tone for the content. The idea was to create very minimalist and digestable content, without being childish and favoring engagement. I proposed a series of animations that would play next to a small snippets of information. Here are some early concepts for those animations:</p>
        <div class="row">
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3" src="assets/img/work/story1.jpg" alt=""></div>
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3" src="assets/img/work/story2.jpg" alt=""></div>
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3" src="assets/img/work/story3.jpg" alt=""></div>
				</div>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> To arrive to the final flow and content proposal we performed several interviews with patients and individuals with similar demographic characteristics. We showed the patients our wireframes and tested for specific issues like readability and cognitive load. This also helped me to define the navigation tree and the user interface componenets for the app. It also helped to create a consistet set of patterns that were implemented in the final design.</p>
        <p class="work-p"> Here is the final proposed user flow with final low fidelity wireframes: </p>
        <p class="work-p"> Patient / Story Mode </p>
        <img src="assets/img/work/pFlow.png" alt="">
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> Health Care Provider Mode </p>
        <img src="assets/img/work/hcpFlow.png" alt="">
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> Wireframe Examples </p>
        <div class="row">
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3-xl" src="assets/img/work/wire1.png" alt=""></div>
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3-xl" src="assets/img/work/wire2.png" alt=""></div>
	        <div class="col-sm-4"><img class="max-image-3-xl" src="assets/img/work/wire3.png" alt=""></div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
    <div class="row solution">
        <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h2 class="centered sechead firstsec"><span class="brackets">[</span>SOLUTION<span class="brackets">]</span></h2>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> The final app is a friendly and encouraging experience that allows patients to comprehend their situation. More importantly this app enables a framework of dialogue between the patients and the health care providers. Patients who learn about their disease through this experience are in a better position to understand their condition and assume the responsibility of being compliant with their treatment and self-aware of the impact their life style has on their well-being.</p>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> Here is a great example of the clarity and simplicity that we were able to deliver with the final app. The dry medicine guide shown before is now transformed into an engaging narrative :</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2" src="assets/img/work/final1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2" src="assets/img/work/final2.png" alt=""></div>
        </div>
        <div class="row special-margin">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2" src="assets/img/work/final3.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="max-image-2" src="assets/img/work/final4.png" alt=""></div>
        </div>
        <p class="work-p special-margin"> Finally, here is a video demo that shows the fluidness of the interactions
        and the use of different navigational elements and feedback loops to increase comprehension and effectiveness:</p>
